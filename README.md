# GENIE_UnitTests

This is the initial collection of unit tests for the GENIE nu(bar)+A event generator.

It has been tested with a "trunk" revision of genie/generator built with the against
"e7:prof" installs of root v5_34_25a, lhapdf v5_9_1b, and log4cpp v1_1_1b.

It also requires boost v1_57_0 with the e7:prof qualifier.

It is NOT guaranteed to build and/or run vs more modern versions of boost (such as
boost v1_63_0a -q e10:prof). Will be revised and updated shortly.
