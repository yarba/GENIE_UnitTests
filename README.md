# GENIE_UnitTests

This is the initial collection of unit tests for the GENIE nu(bar)+A event generator.

As of Feb.2018, we have two branches - master and genie_r2xx_series.

==========

Master is meant to work with the ongoing development towards GENIE v3-series, and is adapted
to its code infrastructure that recently went through a major restructuring.

It has been tested with the "e14:prof" installs of root v6_10_04d, lhapdf v5_9_1h, log4cpp v1_1_2,
and boost v1_64_0.

==========

Branch genie_r2xx_series is supposed to be compatible with the R-2_X_Y series (e.g. 2_12_10
release that is expected shortly).

It has been tested with a "trunk" revision of genie/generator built with the against
"e7:prof" installs of root v5_34_25a, lhapdf v5_9_1b, and log4cpp v1_1_1b.

It also requires boost v1_57_0 (with the e7:prof qualifier as installed at FNAL).

It should also build and run with boost v1_63_0a, e10:prof install (current at FNAL ?).
However, in the reasonably near future we plan some updates to the application code 
since boost 1.6x series has some additional attractive features and functionalities
that were not available in version 1_57_0.

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TESTS

Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one 
or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and 
operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they perform as exopected.

The most traditional unit test exercises the lowest level componests, e.g. public methods of 
a particular class in the simplest application.
E.g. the simplest and perhaps the most classical example is to instantiate an object by calling 
its constructor, then call one or several public methods and ensure their perform as expected,
via comparing against well defined metric. 

In the concept of GENIE the situation is somewhat more complex and in order to test features even 
of a single class one often need several other classes/components to be involved.

However, the idea of this unit testing suite is to implement (and maintain) a collection of
simplest possible application that would exercise features of various GENIE code components 
as fast as feasible.

CODE INFRASTRUCTURE

GENIE Unit Test Suite cirrently resides in
https://github.com/yarba/GENIE_UnitTests

In order to detect failures and/or deviation from expected and/or to report seccessfull completion, 
GENIE Unit Test Suite is using features of  the boost unit testing framework: 
https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_44_0/libs/test/doc/html/utf.html

The Suite is organized as follows:

src/MasterUT contains high level code, main and initialization, that glue various tests together 
and run them in one go.
The list of unit test applications is defined in /src/MasterUT/ExternalFunctions.h 

src/XSecUT contains applications that unit-test features/methods of LwlynSmith and Nieves cross section
models and ensure that these components perform as expected.
If additional unit tests for cross section models are to be implemented, they should be committed 
to this subdirectory.

src/ReWei contains an application that tests so-called ReWeighting module which calculates uncertanties 
(ina form of event weight) associated with variations of parameters of the CCQE cross-section model.
An additional application, for the NCEL cross-esction reweighting tools, is in progress.
If more unit tests for GENIE reweighting modules are to be added, they should be committed to this 
subdirectory. 

As more unit test application for other GENIE code components are implemented, additional subdirectories
maybe created, as needed.

Makefiles are supplied in each subdirecory to build the applications.

src/Makefile is a "master" makefile that steers the build procedure through the right subdirectories 
in the right order.

==========

Provided that GENIE, required extefrnal packages, and boost package are properly setup, one can build
the Unit Tests by issueing the `make' command in the `src' directory.

HUMBLE SUGGESTIONS FOR DEVELOPERS/CONTRIBUTORS

We would like to offer several tips to potential contributors who are to develop additional 
unit test applications.

This tips aim at working on the GENIE virtual machine at FNAL: geniegpvm01.fnal.gov

In principle, a family of GENIE releases and all the necessary external toools are centrally installed 
in the cvmfs space and are accessible from geniegpvm01.

However, we presume that developers will work with their own build of GENIE.

We assume building GENIE vs root v6-series (although building vs root5-series is also possible). 

(Example) Instructions below show how to build GENIE on geniegpvm01 using pre-facbricated 
external packages.

 source /cvmfs/fermilab.opensciencegrid.org/products/genie/bootstrap_genie_ups.sh  
 setup root v6_10_04d -q e14:nu:prof
 setup lhapdf v5_9_1h -q e14:prof
 setup log4cpp v1_1_2 -q e14:prof

 cd <your-work-area>

If you wish to check out public revision of GENIE (incl. trunk) with read-only access, please do:

 svn co --quiet http://genie.hepforge.org/svn/generator/trunk <your-genie-area>

If you need read-write SVN access to the GENIE core code (password required), please do:

 svn co --username <you-user-rname> https://genie.hepforge.org/svn/generator/trunk <your-genie-area>
 
If you need to work out of a specific development/feature branch, you should check out such branch:

 svn co --username <your-user-name> https://genie.hepforge.org/svn/generator/devel/branches/<branch-name> <your-genie-area>

To build GENIE:

 cd <your-genie-area>

Setup mandatory GENIE environment variable :

 GENIE=$PWD
 
Configure GENIE build:
 
 ./configure \
  --enable-test \
  --enable-numi \
  --enable-gsl \
  --enable-rwght \
  --enable-lhapdf5 \
  --with-optimiz-level=O3 \
  --with-pythia6-lib=$PYTHIA6_LIBRARY \
  --with-lhapdf5-lib=$LHAPDF_FQ_DIR/lib \
  --with-lhapdf5-inc=$LHAPDF_FQ_DIR/include \
  --with-log4cpp-lib=$LOG4CPP_FQ_DIR/lib \
  --with-log4cpp-inc=$LOG4CPP_FQ_DIR/include \
  --with-libxml2-lib=$LIBXML2_FQ_DIR/lib \
  --with-libxml2-inc=$LIBXML2_FQ_DIR/include/libxml2 1>configure.out 2>configure.err

If you need a debug build of GENIE, you'll need to activate the debug option and to use O0 optimization
instead of O3; please use the following flags on input to the configure script:

  --enable-debug 
  --with-optimiz-level=O0 
  
Build GENIE:

 make
  
Extend LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH:

 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GENIE/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 PATH=$GENIE/bin:$PATH


In order to build GENIE_UnitTests you'll also need boost packakge wichi is also centrally
available on geniegpvm01:

 setup boost v1_64_0 -q e14:prof


Obtain GENIE Unit Tests Suite:
The easiest way to get started is to clone the Suite from GitHub:

 cd <your-work-area>
 git clone https://github.com/yarba/GENIE_UnitTests.git

NOTE: in principle, for future development it may be more practical to fork Git GENIE_UnitTest
repository, do all the development there, then initiate a Git pull request to have updates
megred into the main branch.

To build the Unit Tests Suite, go to the GENIE_UnitTests/src directory and eecure "make":

 cd GENIE_UnitTests/src
 make

To run the suite, do the following:

 MasterUT/master_ut
 
WARNING !!! If you work out of a specific development/feature branch, you should make sure 
that all the configuration files ( config/*.xml, config/G*/*.xml, etc.) are up-to-date.
Otherwise you may experinece problems at run time.
 
 
If you want to develop an additional unit test, you may be interested in the following:

a) Using either XSecUT or ReWeiUT as an example/pattern, create a new subdirecory to populate 
with the new applications
NOTE: The XSecUT applications are a bit simpler than the ReWeiUT ones are. 
E.g. src/XSecUT/lwlyn_ut.cc or src/XSecdUT/nieves_ut.cxx applications maybe easier examples to follow. 
But this may depend on the use case.

b) E.g. src/XSecUT/Makefile can serve an an example of a makefile.

c) Once the application is ready, it can be added to the list of all in src/MasterUT/ExternalFunctions.h
and included in one or another "BOOST_TEST_SUITE", as shown in src/MasterUT/master_init_ut.cxx

MISC: WALK-THROUGH UNIT TEST FOR THE NIEVES XSEC MODEL

The source code for the Nieves XSec unit test is src/XSecUT/nieves_ut.cxx

All necessary (common) header, except NievesQELCCPXSec.h one, are encapsulated in src/XSecUT/CommonXSec.h

First of all, one needs to setup the test.

In order to calculate an XSec, one needs to define an Interaction object, which in turn requires 
an InitialState and a ProcessInfo. All those are setup on lines 18 through 30.

Next, the NievesQELCCPXSec object is instanciated on line 32 and properly configured on line 35.

Lines 37 through 46 are actually the "beef" of the unit test.

Line 37 shows
a) how a public method ValidProcess of the NievesQELCCPXSec object is called
b) how boost's BOOST_CHECK functionality is used to ensure the method returns the right value

Line 41 illustrates how the XSec public mathod of the NievesQELCCPXSec object is called to calculate
differential cross section for a given Interaction and phase space.

Line 43 shows how boost's functionality is used to make sure the calculated cross sections is non-zero.

Line 46 shows how to use boost's functionality to compare the calculated cross section vs predefined
value and to make sure that the difference between the two does not exceed 0.001% (the tolarnce itself
is define at the very beginning of the code, on line 14).

Since this unit test uses only local objects, and no pointers, no "tear down" is needed.
